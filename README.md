#	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course
		In the projects for this courses, I tackled the challenge of developing pseudocode for three distinct data structures; a vector, hash table, and a binary search tree. Then, I was asked to analyze the runtime performance of each structure and ultimately create a functional program. This program was designed to organize and print a list of all courses in alphanumeric order by their course codes while also providing information on the prerequisites for any specific course. 
		
#	How did you approach the problem?
My approach to the problem involved a thorough review of the notes on each requested data structure. I began by outlining the desired final product's appearance. Then, I systematically broke down the problem, identifying where loops, conditionals, and function calls were needed as I worked through each function of every data structure. I emphasized detailed note-taking, writing  more than necessary initially, and refining them as I progressed through completing the program. This method ensured clarity and accuracy in the development process.
