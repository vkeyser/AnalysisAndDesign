## What problem were you solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this courses, I tackled the challenge of developing pseudocode for three distinct data structures; a vector, hash table, and a binary search tree. Then, I was asked to analyze the runtime performance of each structure and ultimately create a functional program. This program was designed to organize and print a list of all courses in alphanumeric order by their course codes while providing information on the prerequisites for any specific course. 
		
## How did you approach the problem?
My approach to the problem involved thoroughly reviewing the notes on each requested data structure. I began by outlining the desired final product's appearance. Then, I systematically broke down the problem, identifying where loops, conditionals, and function calls were needed as I worked through each function of every data structure. I emphasized detailed note-taking, writing  more than necessary initially, and refining them as I progressed through completing the program. This method ensured clarity and accuracy in the development process.

## Consider why data structures are so important to understand.
Data structures are important in programming as they facilitate data organization, optimize memory usage, and enhance software design and architecture. By choosing the appropriate data structure, I can manage memory and prevent leaks and fragmentation while laying the foundation for scalable and maintainable software systems. Understanding how data structures serve as a fundamental building block for learning advanced concepts, provides me a solid groundwork for tackling complex problems. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The hardest part of these was analyzing the runtime for each data structure. I realized quickly that the format of each of my pseudocodes was incredibly different in terms of formatting, and quickly regretted how I accomplished each of them. It leads me to rewrite many of them to have similar formats while also adhering to their specific data structure.

## How did your work on this project expand your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects have taught me the importance of planning and writing detailed notes before I start a project. I've also learned the complexities of implementing various data structures and now appreciate the algorithmic principles behind them.

## How has your work on this project evolved how you write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs?
Throughout this project, I've grasped the importance of crafting clear and understandable pseudocode as a blueprint for program development. It's evident that well-structured pseudocode lays the foundation for effective communication and problem-solving. Translating the pseudocode into functioning programs has sharpened my attention to detail and decision-making skills.
